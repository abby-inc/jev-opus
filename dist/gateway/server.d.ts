/**
 * Local Anthropic-Messages gateway. Claude Code (CLI, IDE extensions, Agent SDK)
 * points ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL here and picks the "jev/…" model in /model.
 * Requests for that model get their prefix stripped and a Jev-chosen effort
 * inserted as a per-message effort statement. Everything else passes through
 * byte-for-byte. Credentials are forwarded unchanged and never logged.
 *
 * Routing decisions are serialized per conversation branch and single-flighted
 * by request fingerprint: an identical request awaits and reuses the prepared
 * transformation instead of routing twice. Every prepared transformation is
 * written to a durable JSONL journal before it is forwarded upstream, so a
 * thread-cache eviction or a gateway restart replays exactly the statements the
 * upstream model saw. Response metadata is parsed incrementally and
 * journaled against distinct request attempts and their shared decision ID.
